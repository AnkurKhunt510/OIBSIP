                <h4>Early Life</h4>
                <p>
                    ☛ Swami Vivekanand was born Narendranath Datta in a Bemgali family, on 12 January 1863 during Makar
                    Sankranti festival.
                    He belonged to traditional family and was one of the nine subling. His father was attorney at the
                    Calcutta High Court.
                    Also, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar, who became a monk at age
                    twenty-five.The progressive,
                    rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his
                    thinking and personality.

                <h4>Education</h4>
                <p>
                    ☛ In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan
                    Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.[30] In 1879, after
                    his
                    family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the
                    Presidency
                    College entrance examination. [31] He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including
                    philosophy,religion, history, social science, art and literature.In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts
                    examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.

                    Spiritual apprenticeship and Ramakrishna Paramhans
                </h4>
                <p>
                    ☛ By the influence of the Brahmo Samaj, he joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was
                    established
                    by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.In 1881 Narendra
                    first
                    met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884. Narendra's
                    first
                    introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's
                    Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The
                    Excursion.While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit
                    Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his
                    students
                    (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.In 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer, and was
                    transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore.

                    Founding of first Ramakrishna Math at Baranagar
                </h4>
                <p>
                    ☛ After Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples. Unpaidrent
                    accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live. Many returned
                    home, adopting a Grihastha (family-oriented) way of life. Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated
                    house at Baranagar into a new math (monastery) for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math
                    was low, raised by "holy begging" (mādhukarī). The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna
                    Math: the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna.

                    Travels in India (1888–1893)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    ☛ In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka — the Hindu religious life of a wandering
                    monk,
                    "without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go". His sole
                    possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and
                    The
                    Imitation of Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of
                    learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He
                    developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the
                    nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with
                    tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions
                    and
                    walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers)
                    and
                    government officials. Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name "Vivekananda",
                    as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, which means "the bliss of discerning wisdom," from Sanskrit
                    viveka and ānanda.

                <p>
                    ☛ Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 and visited several cities in Japan
                    (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo), China and Canada en route to the
                    United States, reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893, where the "Parliament of Religions" took
                    place in September 1893. The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of
                    the Illinois Supreme Court, Charles C. Bonney, to gather all the religions of the world, and
                    show "the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life." It was one
                    of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair. </p>

                    ☛ Vivekananda wanted to join, but was disappointed to learn that no one without credentials from a
                    bona
                    fide organisation would be accepted as a delegate. Vivekananda contacted Professor John Henry
                    Wright of Harvard University, who invited him to speak at Harvard. Vivekananda wrote of the
                    professor, "He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought
                    would give an introduction to the nation".

                    ☛ The ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15 January 1897, and
                    Vivekananda received a warm welcome. In Colombo, he gave his first public speech in the East. From
                    there
                    on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban,
                    Rameswaram,
                    Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an
                    enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train
                    to
                    stop, so they could hear him.

                <p>
                    ☛ On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur
                    Math
                    and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of
                    yoga
                    to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math.
                    At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while
                    meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a
                    blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death.
